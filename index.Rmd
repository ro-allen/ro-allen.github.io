I am a current PhD candidate in the Department of Botany at the University of Otago, supervised by Dr. Linn Hoffmann and Dr. Tina Summerfield. Prior to the University of Otago, I completed an M.Res. in marine biology at Plymouth University supervised by Prof. Jason Hall-Spencer and Dr. Andy Foggo. My research interests centre around the use of high-throughput amplicon sequencing to investigate the community level responses of marine protists and bacteria to climate change. I am particularly interested in the handling of high-throughput sequencing data. 

I am currently working on four main research topics

####1. The impact of ocean acidification on marine biofilms

####2. Bacterioplankton responses to climate change in the oligotrophic ocean

####3. Eukaryotic phytoplankton responses to climate change

####4. Oceanic fronts: a tool for investigating phytoplankton-bacteria interactions
