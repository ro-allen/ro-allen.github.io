I am a PhD candidate at the University of Otago Department of Botany, supervised by [Dr. Linn Hoffmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linn_Hoffmann) and [Dr. Tina Summerfield](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tina_Summerfield).  Previously, I completed an M.Res. in marine biology at Plymouth University supervised by [Prof. Jason Hall-Spencer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Hall-Spencer) and [Dr. Andy Foggo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Foggo). My research interests centre around the fundamental dynamics of the marine microbiome, whilst my PhD thesis focusses on the use of high-throughput amplicon sequencing to investigate the community level responses of marine protists and bacteria to climate change. I am particularly interested in the handling of high-throughput sequencing data.

<b>The impact of ocean acidification on marine biofilms</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Marine biolfilms are heterogenous microhabitats populated by phylogenetically diverse lifeforms. Interestingly, biofilms independently harbour significant biodiversity, including bacterial and protistan autotrophs, protozoan grazers and predators, and heterotrophic bacterial decomposers. Marine biofilms provide a fundamental grazing resource for larger organisms such as gastropods in shallow marine ecosystems, whilst bacteria in biofilms play a further key role by cuing settlement in scleractinian corals and other habitat forming organisms. 
</p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">   
Understanding the effects of ocean acidification on biofilm community composition and succession from both a eukaryotic and prokaryotic perspective is critical, as potential shifts will have ramifications for the settlement of habitat forming organisms, trophic energy transfer in shallow marine ecosystems, and biodiversity directly associated with biofilms. High-throughput amplicon sequencing has opened the door to high taxonomic resolution profiling of marine biofilms, and here I aim to characterise differences in biofilm community composition and succession by using volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> seeps as a proxy of future acidified conditions.
