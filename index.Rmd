I am a PhD candidate at the University of Otago Department of Botany, supervised by [Dr. Linn Hoffmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linn_Hoffmann) and [Dr. Tina Summerfield](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tina_Summerfield).  Previously, I completed an M.Res. in marine biology at Plymouth University supervised by [Prof. Jason Hall-Spencer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jason_Hall-Spencer) and [Dr. Andy Foggo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Foggo). My research interests centre around the fundamental dynamics of the marine microbiome, whilst my PhD thesis focusses on the use of high-throughput amplicon sequencing to investigate the community level responses of marine protists and bacteria to climate change. I am particularly interested in the handling of high-throughput sequencing data.

<b>The impact of ocean acidification on marine biofilms</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Marine biolfilms are heterogenous microhabitats populated by phylogenetically diverse lifeforms. Interestingly, biofilms independently harbour significant biodiversity, including bacterial and protistan autotrophs, protozoan grazers and predators, and heterotrophic bacterial decomposers. Marine biofilms provide a fundamental grazing resource for larger organisms such as gastropods in shallow marine ecosystems, whilst bacteria in biofilms play a further key role by cuing settlement in scleractinian corals and other habitat forming organisms. 
</p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">   
Understanding the effects of ocean acidification on biofilm community composition and succession from both a eukaryotic and prokaryotic perspective is critical, as potential shifts will have ramifications for the settlement of habitat forming organisms, trophic energy transfer in shallow marine ecosystems, and biodiversity directly associated with biofilms. High-throughput amplicon sequencing has opened the door to high taxonomic resolution profiling of marine biofilms, and here I aim to characterise differences in biofilm community composition and succession by using volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> seeps as a proxy of future acidified conditions.

<b>Bacterioplankton responses to climate change in the oligotrophic ocean</b>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Oligotrophic oceans cover ~40% of total ocean surface area, and account ~20% of marine primary production. Bacterioplankton in the oligotrophic ocean are responsible for the majority of photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and recycling of organic material. The productivity of the oligotrophic ocean is closely coupled to the efficiency of organic matter recycling by heterotrophic bacteria as this process largely controls nutrient availability, due to limited inputs from vertical transport and low rates of nitrogen fixation.  The responses of oligotrophic ocean bacterioplankton to ocean acidification and warming are likely to influence overall marine productivity and global biogeochemical cycles. During a transect through the oligotrophic ocean aboard the *RV Tangaroa*, a team of scientists from NIWA and the University of Otago conducted trace-metal clean deckboard incubation experiment providing some of the first data on this topic.
